AS A traveler  
I WANT to see the least expensive flights between two cities, the different currencies used in these cities and a currency exchange rate.  
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly  


GIVEN a flight price checker with form inputs  
WHEN I search for an airport in a city, country or region  
THEN I am presented with a list for aiport codes and where they are located  
WHEN I type the destination and departure airport codes   
THEN I am presented with a list of the cheapest tickets between the two airports, the name of airline providers, and   the currencies used in both cities.   
WHEN I view the list of the cheapest tickets  
THEN I am able to select the number of passengers and a One way or a Round trip  
WHEN I select the number of passengers and a One way or a Round trip and submit the search  
THEN the price changes accordingly  
WHEN I view the different currencies and if they are different  
THEN I am able to choose the currency that I have and the currency that I want to convert to from a dropdown menu  
WHEN I choose each currency  
THEN I am able to input an amount and get the equivalent amount of the other currency  
WHEN I click on view history button  
THEN I am able to view a list of locations that I searched  
WHEN I click on delete history button  
THEN the items in my search history get deleted
